# generative_design_MPEA
This repository demonstrates the application of Non-Dominant Sorting Generative Adversarial Networks (NSGAN) in the generative design of multi-principle element alloys (MPEA). NSGAN represents a innovative generative design framework, synergistically merging the data generation abilities of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) with the multi-objective optimization capabilities of the NSGA-II algorithm. Our approach leverages a comprehensive dataset comprising 1704 MPEA characteristics. This repository offers the complete workflow of the application of the proposed framework, encompassing data parsing, data engineering, property prediction, and the actual implementation of both the GAN and NSGAN models. Furthermore, we've incorporated the code for an online application built upon the trained NSGAN model. This application is crafted using Streamlit, a renowned open-source Python library tailored for crafting interactive web applications.
